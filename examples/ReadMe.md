# Examples 

The following examples are included: 
* Conversion reaction (`examples/conversion_reaction/`)
* Differential protein expression (`examples/differential_protein_expression`)
* Subpopulation differences in NGF-induced Erk1/2 signaling (`examples/subpopulation_differences`)
* Differences mediated by extracellular scaffolds in NGF-induced Erk1/2 signaling (`examples/ECM_differences`)
* Intrinsic noise for a two stage model of gene expression (`examples/two_stage_intrinsic`)


These models require the freely available toolboxes 
* AMICI for simulation (http://icb-dcm.github.io/AMICI/) 
* PESTO for the parameter estimation (http://icb-dcm.github.io/PESTO/)

* SPToolbox for the sigma-point approximation (http://icb-dcm.github.io/SPToolbox/)
