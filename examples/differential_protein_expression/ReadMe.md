# Differential protein expression (one stage)
Before running the simulation file needs to be compiled using the MATLAB Toolbox AMICI. This can be done by running
`./simulation/generate_simFile_oneStage.m`.

This example reproduces the results of the analysis of "Identification of differential protein expression using multivariate data" of Loos et al., Cell Systems (2018).
