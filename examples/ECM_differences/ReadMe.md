# Influence of extracellular scaffolds on pain signaling

Before running, the simulation file needs to be compiled using the MATLAB Toolbox AMICI. This can be done by running
`../subpopulation_differences/simulation/generate_simFile_ErkSignaling.m`.

This example reproduces the results of the analysis of the "influence of extracellular scaffolds on sensitization signaling" of Loos et al., Cell Systems (2018).
