# Influence of extracellular scaffolds on pain signaling

This example reproduces the results of the analysis of the "influence of extracellular scaffolds on sensitization signaling" of Loos et al., Cell Systems (2018).

First the simulation file needs to be compiled using the MATLAB Toolbox AMICI. This can be done by running
`../subpopulation_differences/simulation/generate_simFile_ErkSignaling.m`.

The main file for the analysis is `main_ECM_differences.m`.
