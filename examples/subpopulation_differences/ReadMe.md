# Subpopulation differences of sensory neurons

Before running, the simulation file needs to be compiled using the MATLAB Toolbox AMICI. This can be done by running
`./simulation/generate_simFile_ErkSignaling.m`.

This example reproduces the results of the analysis of causal differences between subpopulations of cultured sensory neurons of Loos et al., Cell Systems (2018).
