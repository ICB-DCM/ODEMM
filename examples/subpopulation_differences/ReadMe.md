# Subpopulation differences of sensory neurons

This example reproduces the results of the analysis of "causal differences between subpopulations of cultured sensory neurons" of Loos et al., Cell Systems (2018).

First the simulation file needs to be compiled using the MATLAB Toolbox AMICI. This can be done by running
`./simulation/generate_simFile_ErkSignaling.m`.

The main file for the analysis is `main_subpopulation_analysis.m`.
