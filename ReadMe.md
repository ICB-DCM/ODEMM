# ODEMM - ODE constrained mixture modeling

ODEMM is a toolbox for modeling heterogeneous cell populations in MathWorks MATLAB using mixture models and ordinary differential equation (ODE) models. 

ODEMM offers 
* models that are able to include mechanistic descriptions of the **means** of individual subpopulations, and 
* hierarchical population models that incorporate **means and covariances** of the individual subpopulations. 

These models are demonstrated in several examples included in the [`examples/`](examples/) directory.

## Installation

If the repository was cloned, [install_ODEMM.m](install_ODEMM.m) needs to be run to add the folders to the MATLAB search path. If the zip archive was downloaded the archive needs to be unzipped before executing the installation script.

## Licensing

See the [ ```LICENSE```](LICENSE) file in the ODEMM source directory.

## Documentation

The usage of ODEMM is shown in some [examples](examples/). Documentation is available in [```ODEMMdoc.pdf```](/doc/ODEMMdoc.pdf).
