# ODEMM - ODE constrained mixture modeling

ODEMM is a toolbox for modeling heterogeneous cell populations in MathWorks MATLAB using mixture models and ordinary differential equation (ODE) models. 

ODEMM offers 
* models that are able to include mechanistic descriptions of the means of individual subpopulations, and 
* hierarchical population models that incorporate means and covariances of the individual subpopulations. 

These function are demonstrated in several examples included in the [`examples/`](examples/) directory.
